# Diet-Generation-As-Sequence
This repository covers the studies including:
1. *Diet Planning with Machine Learning: Teacher-forced REINFORCE for composition compliance with nutrition enhancement* (under review)
2. *(temporary title) Avoid learning poor-quality existing records: An OR-Experts-ML (ORxML) collaboration framework for synthesizing high quality non-existing data of human task* (on-going)

The first study deals with our novel algortihm which combines REINFORCE algorithm with teacher-forcing technique to overcome the limitation, called collapse mode, which comes from *exposure-bias* while using on-policy algorithm.
